	  <h2>Usage</h2>
	  <p class="oe_mt32">
        After installing the module go to Website &rarr; Shop and, for example, add to cart some kind of products. 
	  </p>
	  <div class="oe_demo oe_picture oe_screenshot">
		<img src="add-to-cart.png?1"/>
	  </div>
	</div>
	
	  <div class="oe_span12">
	    <p style="text-indent: 3%;" class="oe_mt32">
		In the section "My Cart" that appears you can see the "Available" column is added. This column shows the total quantity of products available in stock.
	    </p>

		</div>
	  </div>

	  	<div class="oe_span12">
		<p style="text-indent: 3%;" class="oe_mt32">
		  Once quantity of products will be greater than available in stock, the corresponding value in "Quantity" column will turn red and the "Process checkout" button will become inactive.

		Additional useful function of the module is that a customer can be redirected back to My Cart after clicking "Confirm" in the "Shipping & Billing" tab. This happens if some ordered products had been removed from stock, while he was typing his address.
	<p style="text-indent: 3%;">For example, suppose we have two customers: <i>Customer1</i> and <i>Customer2</i>. Assume, <i>Customer1</i> has added a maximum quantity of some available product to cart and he has passed all the steps Review Order &rArr; Shipping & Billing &rArr; Payment &rArr; Confirmation. In this case, Administrator of the Website will receive quotation, where he can confirm sale or cancel it.</p>

	  </div>  
	</div>

	<div class="oe_span12">
	  <p style="text-indent: 3%;" class="oe_mt32">
Suppose now that, at the same time, <i>Customer2</i> orders some quantity of the same product as <i>Customer1</i> and then moves on to the 2nd step (Shipping & Billing) to fill his address. Once Administrator clicks the "Confirm Sale" for <i>Customer1's</i> order, <i>Customer2</i> will not be able to move to the next step, and even the contrary, he will be redirected back to cart after clicking the "Confirm" button.
